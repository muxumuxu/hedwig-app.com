    title: "We have a difficult announcement to make. Starting today we’re winding down the Hedwig service, and Hedwig will be fully retired after a month-long period ending on October 13, 2018. We’re proud that we’ve been able to help so many of you scheduling texts, but we need to focus our resources elsewhere.<br><br>We understand that this won’t be an easy transition. We are committed to maintaining the backend service during the sunset period, but you won't be able to download the app or purchase anymore credits.<br><br>For those who can not do without our app, we recommend an alternative : <div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-top: 20px\"><img alt=\"scheduled logo\" class=\"logo\" src=\"https://scheduledapp.co/wp-content/themes/scheduled/assets/images/logo.png\" srcset=\"https://scheduledapp.co/wp-content/themes/scheduled/assets/images/logo.png 1x, https://scheduledapp.co/wp-content/themes/scheduled/assets/images/logo@2x.png 2x\" style=\"width: 50px; height: 50px; margin-right: 10px\"> <a href=\"https://scheduledapp.com\" style=\"color: #FF424C; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"FF424C\">Scheduled</font></a></div><br>Thank you for your trust using Hedwig and a warm goodbye."
